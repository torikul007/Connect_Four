# Connect_Four


1. HTML Structure:

Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your game. You'll need a grid of cells to represent the game board, and buttons to allow players to drop their discs into the columns
2. CSS Styling:
Use CSS to style your game board and buttons. You can create a grid layout for the game board and style the discs with different colors for each play
3. JavaScript Logic:
Write JavaScript code to handle the game logic. You'll need to track the state of the game, check for a win condition, and switch between players.
4. Game Logic:

Implement the game logic to check for a win condition. You'll need to check for four consecutive discs in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

5. Event Listeners:

Add event listeners to handle player moves. When a player clicks a column button, you should find the lowest empty cell in that column and place their disc there. Check for a win condition after each move.

6. Winning Message:

Display a winning message when a player wins and a message for a draw when the board is full.

7. CSS Animations (optional):

You can add CSS animations to make the game more visually appealing, such as animating the disc dropping into the grid.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have created a fully functional Connect Four game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns, and the game will check for a win or draw condition. This project is a great way to practice web development skills and create an enjoyable interactive experience for users.
